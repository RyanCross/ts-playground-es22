We want to make an app that looks at book titles and decides by our algorithm if they are "eye-catching"

A title is considered eye catching if its substrings of the title match the 
formula:

(L =length of the string being examined === age * V + gpa * C)

age and gpa will be provided with the inputed string
V being vowels in the title and C being consonants. 

Find all substrings that are Eye-catching given a title. (the title will always be a single word)

"Meadow"

age 2,  gpa 3
detect vowels and consonants
V = 3, C = 3 

V,C are based on current substring being examined 
L = 6
